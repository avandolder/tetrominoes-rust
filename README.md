# Tetrominoes

Basic Tetris clone written in Rust using the ggez game framework.

A rewrite of my older Tetrominoes project, that used LOVE2D and Moonscript.

In order to play, clone the project and run `cargo run` in the root directory.
Use left/right to move the pieces, down to make the pieces fall faster, space to
drop the current piece, and up to rotate the piece counter-clockwise.
